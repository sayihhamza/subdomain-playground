# Fixed Cell 1 Code for Kaggle

Replace Cell 1 with this code:

```python
%%bash
# Don't use set -euo pipefail to avoid directory issues
WORKDIR="/kaggle/working"
PROJECT_DIR="$WORKDIR/subdomain-playground"

echo "=========================================="
echo "Cloning Project from GitHub"
echo "=========================================="

# Ensure working directory exists
mkdir -p "$WORKDIR"

# Remove existing copy if it exists
if [ -d "$PROJECT_DIR" ]; then
    echo "Removing existing copy..."
    rm -rf "$PROJECT_DIR"
fi

# Clone fresh copy
cd "$WORKDIR"
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/sayihhamza/subdomain-playground.git subdomain-playground

# Verify clone succeeded
if [ ! -d "$PROJECT_DIR" ]; then
    echo "✗ Clone failed!"
    exit 1
fi

cd "$PROJECT_DIR"

echo ""
echo "✓ Project cloned successfully!"
echo ""
echo "Key files:"
ls -lh scan.py hybrid_scan.py kaggle_scan.py run.sh 2>/dev/null || echo "Files will be available after clone completes"
```

**Key Changes:**
1. Removed `set -euo pipefail` (causes issues with directory changes)
2. Hard-coded `/kaggle/working` path
3. Added `mkdir -p` to ensure directory exists
4. Changed to `$WORKDIR` before cloning
5. Added verification step
6. Added `2>/dev/null` to ls to suppress errors
